# Installing Firmata on WeMos D1 Mini
Below are instructions on how to install firmware on the WeMos D1 Mini that allows its use with Johnny Five and other Node.js projects.

## Initial Setup

1. Get a high quality micro-USB to USB cable. This cannot be understated. A cheap cable will only provide power and an 
unreliable data connection. Get a nice USB cable that you know can transfer data.
1. Install the CH340G USB driver for your computer. In order to communicate over USB, you’ll need to install the proper USB to Serial driver: https://wiki.wemos.cc/downloads. This driver should be signed and ready to go. There are other unsigned versions available, but they are deprecated.
1. Download the Arduino IDE Get the installable IDE, not the Web Editor.
